# Basics of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN)

This repo contains notebooks with toy examples to build intuitive understanding of [Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19756). The repo contains a series of Jupyter notebooks to explore concepts and code to build KANs, designed to build your understanding of KANs gradually, starting from the basics of B-splines used as activation functions and progressing through more complex scenarios including symbolic regression.

## About the Tutorials
With the help of toy examples, notebooks are structured to help in understanding both the theoretical underpinnings and practical applications of KANs. 

1. [B-Splines for KAN](1_splines.ipynb): 
    - Understanding the mathematical construction of B-splines.
    - Exploring how B-splines are used for functional approximation.

2. [Deeper KANs](2_stacked_splines.ipynb)
   - Constructing and understanding [1, 1, 1, ..., 1] KAN configurations.
   - Implementing and exploring backpropagation through stacked splines.

3. [Grid Manipulation in KANs](3_grids.ipynb)
   - How to expand model's capacity through grid manipulation.
   - How KANs prevent catastrophic forgetting in continual learning?

4. [Symbolic Regression using KANs](4_symbolic_learning.ipynb)
   - Training KANs with fixed symbolic activation functions.
   - Understanding the implications of symbolic regression within neural networks.

## Prerequisites
